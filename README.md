# friend-finder-app

In this activity, I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from the users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I used Express to handle routing and made sure you deploy the app to Heroku so other users can fill it out. Enjoy!
